# ðŸ“Œ Pinned

Pinned is an API that returns pinned repositories for the requested username from GitHub. This is ideal for creating a "Pinned Repositories" section on your website.

```http
GET  https://pinned.berrysauce.me/get/username
```

Replace `username` with your GitHub username. Pinned will return the JSON in the following format:

```json
[
    { 
        "author": "berrysauce",
        "name": "whatdevsneed",
        "description": "ðŸ§° Discover new developer tools",
        "language": "HTML",
        "stars": 58,
        "forks": 0
    },
    ...
]
```

If Pinned runs into an error, the response will have a `500` HTTP status code and the following response text:

```json
{
    "detail": "Error parsing HTML",
    "error": ...
}
```

> [!NOTE]  
> This API has a 5 minute cache in place to reduce requests to the origin. With this said, it might take a moment for your pinned repositories to update.

## Development

```

```

Pinned is deployed on [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/). To deploy Pinned, run the following command:
